#### Boolean Search Engine

You will implement a simple in-memory boolean search engine over the jokes
from http://web.hawkesnest.net/~jthens/laffytaffy/.

The documents are read from documents.txt.
The queries to be processed are read from queries.txt.

Your search engine will only need to support AND queries. A multi-word query
is assumed to be an AND of the words. E.g., the query "why because" should be
processed as "why AND because."

The expected output of running python `boolean_search.py` is in `Log.txt`.
